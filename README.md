# Password Generator
## Project Overview

This project is a Random Password Generator. The HTML and CSS were  provided and left as is, and the starter code was provided for JavaScript. The program enables a user to choose parameters for the password including length and types of characters. The program then compiles those selections and randomly generates and shows the password to the user on the screen.

The functionality for this program was written entirely in JavaScript. I learned many new features of JavaScript in the process. I created variables with arrays to provide the user with options and if statements and concat to bring their selections together. To gather the user options, I used prompts, alerts and confirms. I also used the Math.floor and Math.random methods to generate the password. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a tool for any user with a browser to generate a random and potentially complex password, and to have direct input in the length and complexity of the characters.
